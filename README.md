# practice_todo_application

## Overview
Todo needs to write the app. Each task has a name, a description, and an expiration date. You need to send a reminder email 10 minutes before the end date. By default, tasks appear only to the user who created them, but are not visible to other users. However, the user can share the task with another user by typing in his username or email address. At this time, it is possible to share in 2 formats only to see the task, or to see and comment.
